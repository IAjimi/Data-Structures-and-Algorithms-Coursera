# Coursera: Algorithms on Graphs
This repository contains Python solutions to the homeworks for the Algorithms on Graphs Coursera class.

**Week 1 - Graph Decomposition 1**
* [Find an exit from a maze](https://github.com/IAjimi/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Coursera/blob/master/3%20-%20Algorithms%20on%20Graphs/1%20-%20Graph%20Decomposition/finding_an_exit_from_a_maze.py) (Is node reachable?)
* [Find the number of exists needed for a maze](https://github.com/IAjimi/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Coursera/blob/master/3%20-%20Algorithms%20on%20Graphs/1%20-%20Graph%20Decomposition/adding_exits_to_a_maze.py) (Find the number of graph components)

**Week 2 - Graph Decomposition 2**
* [Checking consistency of CS curriculum]() (Is graph cyclical?)
* [Determining an order of courses]() (Find an order in which the whole graph can be visited linearly)
* Strongly connected components

**Week 3 - Paths in Graphs 1**
* [Computing the Minimum Number of Flight Segments]() (Shortest Path)
* Bipartite graphs() (didn't pass Coursera but passed Leetcode)

**Week 4 - Paths in Graphs 2**
* [Computing the Minimum Cost of a Flight]() (Finding shortest path in weighted graph)
* [Detecting Anomalies in Currency Exchange Rates]() (Detecting negative weight cycles)
* Shortest path (Exchanging money optimally)

**Week 5 - Minimum Spanning Trees**
* [Building roads]()
* [Clustering]()
